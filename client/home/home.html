    <h4>HEY WHO ARE YOU ?</h4>
    <p>Hi, i'm Celousco, the developer of this project.</p>
    <h4>And what is this ?</h4>
    <p>A project...</p>
    <h4>A project for ... ?</h4>
    <p>For the Riot Challenge 2016</p>
    <h4>WHAT ?! RITO MADE A CHALLENGE ?</h4>
    <p>Yep, and there was 3 categories, i choose the <b>Usability/Practicality</b></p>
    <h4>Why this ? Your stupid project is just boring !</h4>
    <p>Let me introduce the Master Yies (<img src="http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.8.1/img/champion/MasterYi.png" class="tiny_img"/><img src="http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.8.1/img/champion/MasterYi.png" class="tiny_img"/>)<br>
    Firsty you have a search bar to having the champions that a summoner know well, but it analyze also the datas to determine your favorite lane</p>
    <h4>Analyzing my data ? AND MY PRIVACY ?!</h4>
    <p>In fact, it's from the Riot API, so i'm not sure if i'm right to give this analyzer. But it works, and pretty well</p>
    <h4>I always play Garen as ADC, but your stupid "analyzer" say that i'm a top laner, that sucks.</h4>
    <p>The analyzer works as if you were a "good player" that respects the meta from the champion tags. Because Garen is tagged as a top laner, he will say you're a top laner</p>
    <h4>A friend play a lot of every lanes, how can you determine his favorite lane ?</h4>
    <p>Depending on how many masteries points and champions he have, the analyzer can tell you his main role and lane. Of course if it's too balanced, the analyzer will ignore all the datas and take into account the effictiveness of your role.</p>
    <h4>Effectiveness ? It's the new MMR ?</h4>
    <p>Absolutely not, in fact it's broken. The analyzer use the effectiveness (masteries points divided to the number of champions per role)</p>
    <h4>Alright, and what is this "Team Adviser" button ? I though Adblock was activated...</h4>
    <p>It's not an ad, but a wonderful tool to make some crazy meta. With that, you add your summoner name and the ones of your friends, and it gives you your lanes and your champions</p>
    <h4>But i can't change my lane !</h4>
    <p>I know, it's the beginning, but it gives an order of the power of the adviser, soon you'll be able to select your own lane and even specify how you would like to play (Try hard or just exp)</p>
    <h4>Okay... well let's go !</h4>
